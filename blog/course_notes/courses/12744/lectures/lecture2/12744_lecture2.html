<h1>12.744: Lecture 2</h1>
<h2>Stellar Nucleosynthesis</h2>
<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>Nucleon Decay</h3>

We consider the neutron decay into a proton:
\begin{equation}
n \to  p.
\end{equation}
We need to balance this, however, following:
<ol>
<li>charge</li>
<li>baryons</li>
<li>leptons</li>
</ol>
Therefore, the above becomes:
<table class="center"  border=1 frame=hsides rules=rows>
<tr>
	<th>$n$</th><th>$\to $</th><th>$p$</th><th>$+$</th><th>$e$</th><th>$+$</th><th>$\overline{\nu}_e$</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>$\circ$</th><th>$\to $</th><th>$1$</th><th></th><th>$-1$</th><th></th><th>$\circ$</th><th>(charge)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>$1$</th><th>$\to $</th><th>$1$</th><th></th><th>$\circ$</th><th></th><th>$\circ$</th><th>(baryon numbers)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>$\circ$</th><th>$\to $</th><th>$\circ$</th><th></th><th>$+1$</th><th></th><th>$-1$</th><th>(lepton numbers)</th>
</tr>
</table>
Here, the antineutrino is $\overline{\nu}_e.$
The etymology is that baryons comes from "heavy" and leptons means "light".

<h3>Production of the Elements</h3>

We start with the Big Bang, in which the produced elements were 75% H and 25% He. 
This comes from a large production of $n$ and $p$, for which we note from above that the $n$ are unstable and decay, as well as a minor percentage of $p$, in so doing producing a smattering of other lighter elements, such as, in order of decreasing log mass fraction:
<ul>
<li>$^{4}\text{He}$</li>
<li>$^{2}\text{H}$</li>
<li>$^{3}\text{He}$</li>
<li>$^{3}\text{H}$</li>
<li>$^{7}\text{Be}$</li>
<li>$^{7}\text{Li}$</li>
<li>$^{6}\text{Li}$</li>
</ul>
We can tackle this quantitatively. 
First, we note that:
\begin{equation}
^1_1\text{H} + ^1_1\text{H} \not\to ^2_2\text{He},
\end{equation}
given that the coulomb repulsion of like-charged particles is too strong. 
However, we note that the above is akin to the opposite of our initial discussion, namely:
\begin{equation}
p \to  n + e^+ + \nu_e,
\end{equation}
where $e^+$ is a positron and $\nu_e$ is a neutrino. 
Thus, we can get:
\begin{equation}
^1_1\text{H} + ^1_0n \to  ^2_1\text{H}.
\end{equation}
We can go down the ladder as follows:
\begin{align}
^2_1\text{H} + ^1_1\text{H} &\to  ^3_2\text{He}, \\
^3_2\text{He} + ^3_2\text{He} &\to  ^4_2\text{He} + 2^1_1\text{H}, \\
^4_2\text{He} + ^4_2\text{He} &\to  ^8_4\text{Be}, \\
^8_4\text{Be} + ^4_2\text{He} &\to ^{12}_6\text{C}.
\end{align}
and so on.
This is happening in a star, and only in those stars at which the $(T, P)$ is strong enough to produce these elements, i.e., overcome the repulsion.  
We note that the Be production is not energetically favourable as it has a tendency to split into 2 helium, given the binding energy of Be is much smaller than He. 
Once we get to the conditions to form $^{12}_6\text{C}$, we get the $\alpha$-ladder with the addition of the $\alpha$ particles:
\begin{equation}
^{12}_6\text{C} \to ^{16}_{8}\text{O} \to  ^{20}_{10}\text{Ne} \to \cdots
\end{equation}
These can be produced only in stars that are massive enough to produce the $T, P$ conditions, as stated above, but for those that are, we can get successive rings within the stars that are burning, from the outside in (with increasing mass):
<ol>
<li>H: 7 million years</li>
<li>He: 500,000 years</li>
<li>C: 600 years</li>
<li>Ne: 1 year</li>
<li>O: 6 months</li>
<li>Si: 1 day</li>
</ol>
This occurs as it is energetically favourable to do so, that is we are on the left side of the energy binding curve, namely left of $^{56}$Fe. 
At this point, we have reached the maximum binding energy, and it becomes energetically less favourable to produce elements. There is no energy to be gained from additional burning.
We end stellar nucleosynthesis here. 
As an aside, there is an inverse relationship between mass of star and a lifetime of star.

<h3>C-N-O Cycle</h3>

We have the following important synthesis cycle:
\begin{equation}
^{12}_6\text{C} \to ^{13}_7\text{N} \to  ^{13}_6\text{C} \to ^{14}_7\text{N} \to  ^{15}_8\text{O} \to ^{15}_7\text{N} \to ^{12}_6\text{C} + ^{4}_2\text{He}
\end{equation}
Therefore, we have a catalytic cycle that produces $\alpha$-particles that can be used to produce heavier and heavier elements. 
We note that this only occurs in so called "Second Generation Stars", those that were formed after the first starts composed mainly of H and He exploded into supernovae after $^{56}$Fe conditions are reached.
We note that when $^{56}$Fe can be broken down as follows:
\begin{equation}
^{56}\text{Fe}\to 13^{4}_2\text{He} + 4n,
\end{equation}
therefore these supernovae produce large numbers of $\alpha$-particles and neutrons. 

<h3>Other Production Pathways: $s, r$ processes</h3>

We have two different main pathways that produce most of our elements:
<ul>
<li>slow addition of neutrons: $s$-process, $t_{1 / 2} \sim 10^4$ years. This occurs during the burning of stable stars, which produce $n$ at slow rates</li>
<li>fast addition of neutrons: $r$-process, $t_{1 / 2} \sim 0.1$ seconds. This occurs at the supernovae stage at fast rates during collapse.</li>
</ul>
First, the $s$-process follows along the stability line within the valley of stability.
Second, the $r$-process overshoots the stability line, which will eventually decay back to the valley of stability. 
We note from relative mass abundances that there are always two peaks, the $r$ peak and the $s$ peak, for which the $r$ process is always at lower masses. 
This is because in the decay toward the stability line of the $r$-process, it eventually ends up at a lower mass than the slow addition. 
We can also note that the isotopes on the neutron-rich side of the valley of stability were often created by $r$-processes, while those on the proton rich side were produces by $s$-processes.
There is also shielding effects, in which $r$-process produced elements shield other elements from being produced by the same process, thus making these shielded elements to be produced by the $s$-process. 
There is also the proton addition, or $p$-process, that can produce elements on the proton rich side, but these are low abundance and less favourable to make.
<p>
Fission is the last production pathway, that occurs when atoms get so big that they can spontaneously split a part and form two or more daughter particles with different masses, as discussed previously. 
This occurs when the Coulombic forces are too greater for the atoms to remain intact and stable.
