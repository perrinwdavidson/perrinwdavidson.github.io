<h2>Simple Decay â€“ Radiometric Dating</h2>
<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>Theory</h3>

A review of important terms:
<ol>
<li>Radioactive: decaying</li>
<li>Cosmogenic: from space</li>
<li>Anthropogenic: produced by humans</li>
<li>Primordial: existing at the beginning of the universe</li>
<li>Closed system: a closed box</li>
</ol>
We start with the decay equation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{N}{N_0} = \exp\left[-\lambda t\right].
\end{equation}
We can reforumulate this as:
\begin{equation}
	N = N_0\exp\left[-\lambda t\right],
\end{equation}
or:
\begin{equation}
	N_0 = N \exp\left[\lambda t\right].
\end{equation}
This relates the original number of isotopes (at $t=0$) to the number of isotopes now (at time $t$).
In order to apply this, we can measure $N$ and we can measure  $\lambda$ experimentally. 
However, there are a few unknowns, such as  $t$ and  $N_0$. 
What we can say, though, is that we can note that:
\begin{equation}
	D^* = N_0 - N,
\end{equation}
where $D^*$ is the number of radiogenic daughter nuclides. 
So, we can get a new equation:
 \begin{equation}
	D^* = N\exp\left[\lambda t\right] - N = N\left(\exp\left[\lambda t\right] - 1\right).
\end{equation}
We can then use:
\begin{equation}
	D = D_0 + D^*,
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the total daughter and $D_0$ is the primordial activity. Therefore, we get:
\begin{equation}
	D = D_0 + N\left(\exp\left[\lambda t\right] - 1\right).
\end{equation}
Now, as MS is really good at measuring ratios, we introduce the following:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{D}{D_s} = \frac{D_0}{D_s} + \frac{N}{D_s}\left(\exp\left[\lambda t\right] - 1\right),
\end{equation}
where $D_s$ is the stable isotope of the daughter element.
This is the form used in Eq. (1) in the Patterson (1956).
We can clearly see that this is essentially:
\begin{equation}
	y \sim b + m x,
\end{equation}
which we use in the isochron method.
There is a neat trick for doing the calculations in your head:
\begin{equation}
	\exp\left[\lambda t\right] = 1 + \left(\lambda t\right) + \frac{\left(\lambda t\right)^2}{2!} + \ldots,
\end{equation}
and in special cases for $t \ll \tau_{1 / 2}$, we can forget all terms greater than linear.
Thus, we get:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{D}{D_s} = \frac{D_0}{D_s} + \frac{N}{D_s}\lambda t.
\end{equation}

<h3>Application</h3>

We start with the:
\begin{equation}
^{87} \text{Rb} \to  ^{87} \text{Sr} + \mathcal{C}, 
\end{equation}
via $\beta^-$ decay. So, in order to do this, we want to balance the charges. 
To do this, we need to balance the following:
<ol>
<li>charge</li>
<li>baryons</li>
<li>leptons</li>
</ol>
and then we can balance each based on the decay above and get that:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{C} = e^- + p + \nu^-.
\end{equation}
We can look at the relative abundances of the Sr element and want to choose the stable isotope that is of similar magnitude to the radioactive element.
This is why we want to choose \ch{^{86}Sr} as the normalization isotope.
We can then measure two or more samples and plot the line as discussed previously and get the initial value. 
There are a few major assumptions with this:
<ol>
<li>System was isotopically homogeneous</li>
<li>System was variable in its elemental concentrations,</li>
<li>System has to be closed.</li>
</ol>
As Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink has said: "Without age, we are lost in time".
