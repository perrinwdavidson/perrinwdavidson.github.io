<h4>Calculations</h4>
<p>
We first want to assume a model in which all anthropogenic forcings are placed into the atmosphere, which we define as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}t}\left[\left(C_a \circ \delta^{13}C_{a}\right)(t)\right] = F(t)\delta^{13}C_a,
\end{equation}
where $\left(C_a \circ \delta^{13}C_{a}\right)(t)$ is the weighted product of total carbon in a resevoir denoted by the subscript and the isotope for the same resevoir.
Here, we define $F$ as the emission forcing given by:
\begin{equation}
	F(t) = \left(\frac{2(C_T - \Delta t)}{\Delta t} + r_0\right)t + r_0,
\end{equation}
which provides:
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{F}(t) = \int\text{d}F = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2(C_T - \Delta t)}{\Delta t} + r_0\right)\tilde{t}^2 + r_0\tilde{t},
\end{equation}
for $C_T$ the total emissions over the period $\Delta t$ (i.e., 1950 to 2020), $r_0$ the initial rate of emission (1 [Gt y$^{-1}$]), and $\tilde{t} = t - 1950$.
This is simply the primitive of the linear increase described in the problem, modified to make the rate self-contained with the total emissions discussed in the problem. 
Specifically, we change $C_T$, which we do in the top panel (solid and dashed lines) of Fig. 1, to induce different emission scenarios. The solid line scenario is for  $C_T = 440$ [Gt y$^{-1}$] and the dashed line is for  $C_T = 881 - 612 = 269$ [Gt y$^{-1}$].
</p>
<p>
Now, we can define the mixing relationship used to calculate the isotope values by integrating the first equation, using Separation of Variables to get:
\begin{equation}
	\int_{t'\in\left[t_0,t\right]} \text{d}\left[\left(C_a \circ \delta^{13}C_{a}\right)(t')\right] = \int_{t_0}^t \text{d}t' \text{F}(t')\delta^{13}C_a,
\end{equation}
which gives:
\begin{equation}
C_a(t)\delta^{13}C_a(t) = C_a(t_0)\delta^{13}C_a(t_0) + \widehat{F}(t)\delta^{13}C_{p},
\end{equation}
where $\delta^{13}C_p$ is the constant isotope value for anthropogenic emissions and we assume $t_0=1950$ is at pre-industrial levels.
We present the solutions for the two different emission scenarios in the middle plot of Fig. 1 (solid and dashed).
</p>
<p>
Next, we define a piece-wise forcing function for $\Delta^{14}C$ of the form:
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{14}C_s(t) = \begin{cases}
				-20 & 1950 \le t < 1955 \\
				-20 + 75 \tilde{t} & 1955 \le  t < 1965 \\
				730 & 1965 \le t
		      \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This is based on analysis and discussion from Graven <i>et al. </i> (2017).
We then correct for decay by:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta^{14}C(t) = \Delta^{14}C_s(t)\exp\left[\lambda\left(t_p - \widehat{t}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where $t_p$ is the data of production (starting in 1955 and ending in 1965), $\widehat{t} = t - 1955$, and $\lambda = \ln 2 / 5730$ [y$^{-1}$].
We plot $\Delta^{14}C(t)$ in the bottom plot of Fig. 1.

<h4>Comparison to Data</h4>
<p>
From the problem, we plot the piece-wise "observed" data (other than the actual observational data, in the dotted line in the middle panel of Fig. 1) in the dot-dash line in the middle plot of Fig. 1, for which we use the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	\delta^{13}C(t) = -6.6 -0.025\tilde{t},
\end{equation}
from the problem.
