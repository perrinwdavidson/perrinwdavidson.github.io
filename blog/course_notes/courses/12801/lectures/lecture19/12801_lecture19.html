<h1>12.801: Lecture 19</h1>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h2>The Setup</h2>

<p>
There are two paradigms of ocean circulation:
<ol>
	<li> [Laminary flow]: This is the steady-state flow that was considered by Sverdrup.</li>
	<li> [Turbulent flow]: This is the idea that the ocean is fundamentally turbulent. Such people that are in this camp are researchers like Victor Starr (though a meteorologist).</li>
</ol>
Now, we note that in the oceans, and geostrophic theory, we have boundaries, and therefore, we have a different regime in the ACC than in other parts of the world.
To make this explicit, we can say that:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{D}q}{\textrm{D}t} = 0,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
	q = \partial_xv - \partial_yu + f.
\end{equation}
Then, we will consider a Taylor Column is as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{D}}{\textrm{D}t}\left(\xi + f\right)= 2\Omega \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}, 
\end{equation}
where we have the $\partial_z w$ the "Vortex Stretching" term and behaves:
\begin{align}
 \text{Stretch:} \quad \partial_zw > 0 &\quad \rightarrow \quad \text{Counter Clockwise / Cyclonic} \\ 
 \text{Compress:} \quad \partial_zw < 0 &\quad \rightarrow \quad \text{Clockwise / Anti-Cyclonic}
\end{align}
We have a westward phase propogation which is characteristic of Rossby Waves.

<h2>Theory (QGPV)</h2>

<p>
We have the GQPV as follows:
\begin{equation}
	q = \nabla^2\Psi + \beta y + \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(\frac{f_0^2}{N^2}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z} \right).
\end{equation}
Now, we are going to use:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{D}q}{\textrm{D}t} = 0,
\end{equation}
and we will linearize. Specifically, we are going to theorize there is a mean flow $\overline{u}\left(z\right)$ and a planetary vorticity gradient $\beta$.
Then, we have:
\begin{align}
	u &= \overline{u} + u', \\
	q &= \overline{q} + q'.
\end{align}
From here, we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q'}{\partial t} + \overline{u}\frac{\partial q'}{\partial x} + v'\frac{\partial \overline{q}}{\partial y} = 0.
\end{equation}
The second term leads to baroclinic instability and the third term leads to Rossby waves.
We \start with $\overline{u}=0$, which is to say there is no large scale mean flow in the ocean.
Then, we get \hat{t} $\beta=\frac{\partial \overline{q}}{\partial y}.$
This gives use the Rossby Wave equation:
\begin{equation}
	\boxed{
	\frac{\partial q'}{\partial t} + \beta v'=0.}
\end{equation}
From here, we note \hat{t}:
\begin{equation}
	q'=\nabla^2\Psi'+\beta y + \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(F\left(z\right) \frac{\partial \Psi'}{\partial z} \right),
\end{equation}
where $F = fo^2 / N^2 .$
We are considering a stratified ocean of depth $D$, which means we have some $N^2$.
We further let $w=0$ at the top and bottom of the ocean.
Now, we know:
\begin{equation}
	b'=f_0 \frac{\partial \Psi'}{\partial z}, 
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial b'}{\partial t} +wN^2=0.
\end{equation}
This then means $b'=0$ at the top and  $\Psi_z=0$ at the top and bottom, as well. These are known as Neumann Boundary conditions.
We want to look for plane wave solutions, i.e. solutions of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\Psi' = \hat{\Psi}\exp\left[i\left(kx+ly-\omega t\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where we have:
\begin{align}
	L_x &= \frac{2 \pi}{k}, \\
	L_y &= \frac{2 \pi}{l}.
\end{align}
Now, we can get all of the terms in the derivatives for the ansatz above and get:
\begin{equation}
	q' = \left[-\left(k^2+l^2\right)+\frac{\partial }{\partial z}F \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\right]\hat{\Psi}. 
\end{equation}
We can then further get:
\begin{equation}
q' = -i\omega\left[-K^2 + \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(F \frac{\partial \hat{\Psi}}{\partial z} \right) \right] + \beta k \hat{\Psi} = 0.
\end{equation}
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\begin{equation}
	\omega \left[\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left(F \frac{\partial \hat{\Psi}}{\partial z}\right) - K^2\hat{\Psi}\right] - k\beta \hat{\Psi} = 0.
\end{equation}
We have the BCs:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \hat{\Psi}}{\partial z} = 0 \quad \text{ at } \quad z = 0, -D. 
\end{equation}
From the BCs, we can see we have a solution of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\Psi} = \cos\left[\frac{m \pi z}{D}\right] \quad \text{ for } \quad m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
\end{equation}
Now, we will let $N^2= $ const. and therefore $F= $ const. Substituting in this equation in to our equation above, we get:
\begin{equation}
	-\omega\left[\frac{f_0^2}{N^2}\frac{m^2\pi^2}{D^2}+K^2\right]-\beta k = 0.
\end{equation}
This then gives the dispersion relation for baroclinic Rossby waves:
\begin{equation}
	\omega = - \frac{\beta k}{K^2 + K_m^2} \quad \text{ for } \quad K_m = m \pi \left(\frac{f_0}{ND}\right).
\end{equation}
This is a "Rigid Lid" approximation for the ocean, which is not a good approximation for the atmosphere.
From above, we note  $K_m$ are known as the "Deformation Wave Numbers" and are the inverses of the Rossby Radius of Deformation: $K_m = 1 / L_{R_m}$.
For $m=0$, we have the "barotropic" mode and then we go to the "$m$th barclinic mode". 
We can estimate these radii from $N / f_0 = 0$ and $D = 50$ [km], we get: $L_{R_1} = 48 $ [km], $L_{R_2} = 24$ [km].
</p>
Now, if we make the "long-wave approximation" given by: $K^2 \ll K_m^2$, then we have:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\omega}{k} = -\frac{\beta}{K_m^2} = - \beta L_{R_1}^2.
\end{equation}
This is the speed of long baroclinic, 1st mode Rossyby waves. 
It turns out almost of the energy in teh ocean is in the 1st mode.
There is something called an inverse cascade and energy cascades to the 1st baroclinic mode.
