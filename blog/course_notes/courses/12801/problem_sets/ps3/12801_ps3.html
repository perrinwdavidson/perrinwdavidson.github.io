<h1>12.801: Problem Set 3</h1>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>The Setup</h3>

We consider the Stommel wind-driven gyre model, which has the linear vorticity balance:
\begin{equation}
	\beta \partial_x\psi = \frac{f}{D}\left( w_{Ek} - w_B \right) - \epsilon \Delta \psi,
\end{equation}
where we define the Laplacian as $\Delta = \nabla^{2}$. 
We can derive this equation by considering a single layer of homogeneous fluid with depth $D$ that is below a mixed layer of thickness $h_M$ which transports the wind stress and corresponding Ekman transport into the layer. 
At the bottom of the layer of thickness $\delta_E$, there is a viscous boundary layer wherein the viscous stresses produced by the fluid motion against the bottom act on the fluid layer.
We assume that in this layer, the north-south motion is small enough that the $\beta$-plane approximation is valid and that the velocity of the fluid is small enough that the fluid is in geostrophic balance such that:
\begin{equation}
	\beta L / f_0 \ll 1,
\end{equation}
which allows us to write the fluid motion as:
\begin{equation}
	u = - \partial_y\psi \quad \text{ and } \quad v = \partial_x\psi,
\end{equation}
where we define $\psi = p / \rho f_0$.
We also define the total vorticity as a summation of the relative vorticity and the planetary vorticity, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
	Q = \zeta + f = \partial_xv - \partial_yu + f_0 + \beta y.
\end{equation}
Now, as the horizontal velocities are independent of depth, we have that the only way our vorticity equation $Q$ for this model can be modified is if there is a change in the vortex stretching (i.e., a vertical change in $w$) or in lateral diffusion. 
We can write this as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{d}Q}{\textrm{d}t} = \left(\zeta + f_0 + \beta y \right)\partial_z w + A_H \Delta \zeta,
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the horizontal diffusivity $A_H$. 
By our definition of the model above as geostrophic, we know that $\beta y  \ll f_0$ and $\zeta \ll f_0$, for the second term being that the relative vorticity $\zeta$ is small given that the velocities and their rates of change small.
Therefore, we can write the above equation as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{d}\zeta}{\textrm{d}t} + \beta v = f_0 \partial_z w  + A_H \Delta \zeta.
\end{equation}
Assuming hydrostatic balance, $\partial_z p = - \rho g$, we can integrate the above equation with respect to $z$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\textrm{d}Q}{\textrm{d}t} + \beta v - A_H \Delta \zeta \right) \int_{-D}^0 \text{d}z = f_0\int_{w_B^\ast}^{w_{Ek}} \text{d}w,
\end{equation}
giving, assuming steady state (i.e., time-independent circulation):
\begin{equation}
	\beta v = \frac{f_0}{D}\left( w_{Ek} - w_B^\ast \right) + A_H \Delta \psi,
\end{equation}
where we have assumed that the limits of our vertical velocity are composed into:
\begin{align}
	\text{Top: }& w_{Ek,}  \\
	\text{Bottom: }& w_B^\ast = w_B + w_{Ek,B},
\end{align}
where $w_{Ek}$ is the Ekman vertical velocity at the surface produced by wind stress and transported through the mixed layer, $w_B = - \underline{u}\cdot \nabla D$ is the vertical velocity at the bottom of the single homogeneous layer induced by the bottom fluid flow $\underline{u}_B$, and $w_{Ek, B}$ is the bottom vertical Ekman velocity.
From Pedlosky (1987), we know that we can define:
\begin{equation}
	w_{Ek,B} = \frac{\delta_E}{2}\zeta.
\end{equation}
Therefore, substituting in our relation between the streamfunction and the meridional velocity, we get:
\begin{equation}
	\beta \partial_x\psi = \frac{f_0}{D}\left( w_{Ek} - w_B \right) - \epsilon\Delta\psi + A_H \nabla ^4 \psi,
\end{equation}
where we introduced the factor:
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon = \frac{f_0\delta_E}{2D}.
\end{equation}
The Stommel model does not consider the lateral transfer of momentum to a coast through turbulent stresses (unlike the Munk model), rather the stress from the bottom Ekman layer, i.e. we neglect the fourth-order $\nabla ^4\psi$ term but keep the second-order $\Delta\psi$ term in the equation above.
Thus, we arrive at the model we are interested in this problem set, namely:
\begin{equation}
	\beta \partial_x\psi = \frac{f_0}{D}\left( w_{Ek} - w_B \right) - \epsilon \Delta \psi.
\end{equation}
