<h1>12.801: Problem Set 4</h1>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>Setting up the problem</h3>

We are given a domain defined as:
\begin{equation}
	0 < x < L_x \quad \text{ and } \quad 0 < y < 2L_y.
\end{equation}
We are further given an Ekman pumping field of the form:
\begin{equation}
	w_{Ek} = - \frac{\pi \tau_x}{\rho_0 f L_y}\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right].
\end{equation}
This induces a "double gyre", which is a subtropical gyre in the south (anti-cyclonic) and a subpolar gyre in the north (cyclonic).
Now, in this problem set we want to construct the 3-layer, quasi-geostrophic model given by the following vorticity equations (neglecting planetary vorticity):
\begin{align}
	q_1 &= \beta y - F\left(\psi_1 - \psi_2\right), \\
	q_2 &= \beta y + F\left(\psi_1 + \psi_2 - 2\psi_2\right), \\
	q_3 &= \beta y + F\left(\psi_2 - \psi_3\right),
\end{align}
where we have $F =  f_0^2 / g' H$ and we relate the streamfunctions via assuming the depth-integrated flow is in Sverdrup balance:
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{geo} = H\left(\psi_1 + \psi_2 + \psi_3\right).
\end{equation}
We define $g'$ as the reduced gravity between the layers.
Furthermore, we will define three regions for which we will derive both the streamfunctions, $\psi^j_i$, and the potential vorticity, $q^j_i$, valid in each region.
Note the convention used here, in which $i, j \in \left[1, 2, 3\right]$ and $i$ indexes the level and $j$ the region in which the variable is valid.
We illustrate the regions in Fig. 1.

	<img src="images/regions.png" style="width:40%">
	<figcaption> Fig. 1: The three regions for which we will derive the valid streamfunctions and potential vorticity equations in each layer.</figcaption>
</figure>
We note regions II and III are so called "pool" regions, for which there will be homogenized potential vorticity in the second and third layers.

<h3>Problem 1 (Geostrophic Streamfunction)</h3>

We are first given the geostrophic streamfunction is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{geo} = \frac{f}{\beta}\int_{\text{eastern boundary}}^x \text{d}x w_{Ek}.
\end{equation}
We can preform this integral, assuming the eastern boundary is $L_x$, to get:
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{geo} = \frac{\pi \tau_x L_x}{\beta \rho_0 L_y}\left(1 - \frac{x}{L_x}\right)\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right].
\end{equation}
Now, we take the following values, which we will use for the remainder of the problem set:
\begin{align}
	\tau_x &\sim 1 \times 10^{-1} \: \left[\text{kg} \text{ m}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\right], \\	
	L_y &\sim 3 \times 10^{6} \: \left[\text{m}\right], \\
	L_x &\sim 3 \times 10^{6} \: \left[\text{m}\right], \\
	\beta &\sim 2 \times 10^{-11} \: \left[\text{s}^{-1} \text{m}^{-1}\right], \\
	\rho_0 &\sim 1 \times 10^{3} \: \left[\text{kg} \text{ m}^{-3}\right], \\
	f_0 &\sim 1 \times 10^{-4} \: \left[\text{s}^{-1}\right], \\
	g' &\sim 2 \times 10^{-2} \: \left[\text{m} \text{ s}^{-2}\right] .
\end{align}
We plot both the Eckman pumping field and the geostrophic streamfunction in Fig. 2 with these values. 
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob1.png" style="width:100%">
	<figcaption> Fig. 2: The Eckman pumping field, $w_{Ek}$ and the corresponding geostrophic streamfunction, $\Psi_{geo}$. </figcaption>
</figure>
For the sake of simplicity, we will follow Marshall and Speer and define:
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{Sv} = \frac{\pi \tau_x L_x}{\beta \rho_0 L_y} \sim \text{max}\left[\Psi_{geo}\right] \sim 7.85 \:\left[\text{Sv}\right],
\end{equation}
so we will deal with the geostrophic streamfunction of the form:
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{geo} = \Psi_{Sv}\left(1 - \frac{x}{L_x}\right)\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right].
\end{equation}

<h3>Problem 2 (Region I)</h3>

We will begin to build the full three-layer model by first assuming the flow is confined to the top layer. 
Mathematically, we can write this as:
\begin{align}
	\psi^1_1 &= \frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H}, \\
	\psi^1_2 &= 0, \\
	\psi^1_3 &= 0.
\end{align}
Therefore, we have the following 6 equations describing the flow in the Region I, for the streamfunctions:
\begin{align}
	\psi^1_1 &= \frac{\Psi_{Sv}}{H}\left(1 - \frac{x}{L_x}\right)\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right], \\
	\psi^1_2 &= 0, \\
	\psi^1_3 &= 0,
\end{align}
and for potential vorticity:
\begin{align}
	q^1_1 &= \beta y - \frac{F\Psi_{Sv}}{H}\left(1 - \frac{x}{L_x}\right)\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right], \\
	q^1_2 &= \beta y + \frac{F\Psi_{Sv}}{H}\left(1 - \frac{x}{L_x}\right)\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right], \\
	q^1_3 &= \beta y.
\end{align}
In order to plot these values, we will first calculate $F$ and $H$, as we are assuming all layer thicknesses are the same. 
First, we assume, from the problem:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{F \Psi_{Sv}}{\beta L_y H} = 2.
\end{equation}
As we know the definition of $F$, we can rearrange to get, for the values given above:
 \begin{equation}
	H = \left(\frac{f_0^2\pi\tau_xL_x}{2g'\rho_0\beta^2L_y^2}\right)^{1 / 2} \sim 181 \:\left[\text{m}\right],
\end{equation}
and therefore calculate:
\begin{equation}
	F = \frac{f_0^2}{g'H} \sim  2.76 \times 10^{-9} \: \left[\text{m}^{-2}\right].
\end{equation}
Next, we need to determine the boundaries of Region I, as shown in Fig. 1. 
To do this, we will note the curve the demarcates Region I is given by equating $q^1_2$ with the reference value of QGPV at the center of the basin, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
	q_2^1 = \beta y + F\psi_1^1 = \beta L_y.
\end{equation}
We can think of this as the PV homogenization in the "pool region" that will be discussed in the next section.
So, we can solve this given our solution for $\psi_1^1$ from above, giving:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{y}{L_y} + \frac{F\Psi_{Sv}}{\beta L_y H}\left(1 - \frac{x}{L_x}\right)\sin\left[\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right] = 1,
\end{equation}
from which we solve for $x$ (as for $y$ it is currently a transcendental equation) to select dependent $x$ based on prescribed independent $y$ values.
Noting the coefficient in the second term on the LHS is assumed to be 2, we get:
\begin{equation}
	x = L_x \left(1 - \frac{1 - y / L_y}{2\sin\left[\pi y / L_y\right]}\right).
\end{equation}
We plot the resulting bounds in Fig. 3.
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob2a.png" style="width:40%">
	<figcaption> Fig. 3: The bounds between Region I and Region II, as quantified above and graphically represented in Fig. 1.</figcaption>
</figure>
Now, we plot $\psi_1^1$ in Fig. 4 (but not $\psi_2^1$ or $\psi_3^1$ as these are 0). 
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob2b.png" style="width:40%">
	<figcaption> Fig 4: The streamfunction $\psi_1^1$ (left) over the entire domain (right) over Region I in which it is valid.</figcaption>
</figure>
As confirmed by the maths, this is simply the geostrophic streamfunction normalized to the height of the layers, $H.$
Next, we will plot the entire domain solution for $q^1_i$ in Fig. 5 below. 
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob2c.png" style="width:100%">
	<figcaption> Fig 5: The QGPV $q_i^1$ over the entire domain, where the dashed red line separates the pool region (left, closed region) to the shadow zone (right, open region) }.</figcaption>
</figure>
We note the "pool region" which is defined above in $q^1_2$ by those contours which only intersect with the western boundary and the "shadow zone" by those contours which intersect the eastern boundary.
The dashed red line demarkates these different regions, and is defined by the Region I boundary above.

<h3>Problem 3 (Region II)</h3>

We are moving onto the second region, in which we have the following equations for the streamfunctions:
\begin{align}
	\psi_1^2 + \psi_2^2 &= \frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H}, \\
	\psi_3^2 &= 0,
\end{align}
which means we have the following QGPV equations:
\begin{align}
	q_1^2 &= \beta y - F\left(\psi_1^2 - \psi_2^2\right), \\
	q_2^2 &= \beta y + F\left(\psi_1^2 - \psi_2^2\right) = \beta L_y, \\
	q_3^2 &= \beta y + F\psi_2^2.,
\end{align}
noting the assumption $q_2^2 = \beta L_y$ of homogenization of GQPV in the pool region.
From our streamfunction Sverdrup relation, we can get the relation:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_1^2 = \frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H} - \psi_2^2.
\end{equation}
Therefore, we can start our solutions by finding first:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_2^2 = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H} - \frac{\beta}{F}\left(L_y - y\right)\right),
\end{equation}
which we can plug in to our relation above to get:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_1^2 = \frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H} - \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H} - \frac{\beta}{F}\left(L_y - y\right)\right),
\end{equation}
and of course we still $\psi_3^2 = 0$.
The next calculation used in this problem is the demarkation between Region II and Region III. 
We follow a similar procedure as before, in which we let:
\begin{equation}
	 q_3^2 = \beta y + F\psi_2^2 = \beta L_y,
\end{equation}
plug in our solution for $\psi_2^2$ and solve for $x$ to get:
\begin{equation}
	x = L_x\left(1 - \frac{4H\beta}{\Psi_{Sv}F\sin\left[\pi y / L_y\right]}\left(L_y - y\right)\right).
\end{equation}
We again use the demarkation region between I and II which we found previously to provide the appropriate solutions for $q_i, \psi_i$ in the appropriate regions.
Now, we plot these boundaries in Fig. 6
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob3a.png" style="width:40%">
	<figcaption> Fig 6: Boudaries between Regions I, II, and III.</figcaption>
</figure>
After applying the boundary to properly demarkate the solutions, we plot the streamfuncions in the top two layers in Fig. 7.
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob3b.png" style="width:100%">
	<figcaption> Fig 7: The streamfunctions for flow in the top two layers (left) $\psi_1$ and (right) $\psi_2$.</figcaption>
</figure>
The dashed red line is the boundary between Region I and II used in this solution.
We can then apply the same routine to demarkate the solutions for the QGPV in Fig. 8.
<figure>
	<img src="images/prob3c.png" style="width:100%">
	<figcaption> Fig 8: The QGPV for the three layers. </figcaption>
</figure>
Note the addition of the blue dashed line in the $q_3$ plot.
The region within this region is the closed, pool region whereas the region outside of this blue line, which has contours reaching the eastern boundary, is the shadow zone.
Additionally, note the homogenization (by assumption) of the QGPV in $q_2$.

<h3>Problem 4 (Region III)</h3>

We move on to Region III, having equations of the form:
\begin{align}
	\psi_1^3 + \psi_2^3  + \psi_3^3 = \frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H}, \\
\end{align}
which means we have the following QGPV equations:
\begin{align}
	q_1^3 &= \beta y - F\left(\psi_1^3 - \psi_2^3\right), \\
	q_2^3 &= \beta y + F\left(\psi_1^3 + \psi_3^3 - \psi_2^3\right) = \beta L_y, \\
	q_3^3 &= \beta y + F\left(\psi_2^3 - \psi_3^3\right) = \beta L_y.
\end{align}
noting the assumption $q_2^2 = q_2^3 = \beta L_y$ of homogenized QGPV in the pool region.
To get solutions for these equations, we begin with manipulating the Sverdrup balance equation to get:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_1^3 + \psi_3^3 = \frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H} - \psi_2^3, 
\end{equation}
from which we can plug into our equation for $q_2^3$, for which we know the homogenization, meaning we can solve to get:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_2^3 = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\Psi_{geo}}{H} + \frac{\beta}{F}\left(y - L_y\right)\right).
\end{equation}
Plugging this into our equation for $q_3^3$ to get:
 \begin{equation}
	\psi_3^3 = \frac{\beta}{F}\left(y - L_y \right) + \psi_2^3.
\end{equation}
Lastly, we get:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_1^3 = \frac{\beta}{F}\left(L_y - y\right) - \psi_3^3 + 2\psi_2^3.
\end{equation}
Okay, so know we present the full, three-layer, three-flow results. 
First, we plot the solution for the three streamfunctions, using the respective bounds to piece together the appropriate solutoins to get those shown in Fig. 9.

	<figcaption> Fig 10: the QGPV for flow in all three layers, again demarkated by the dashed lines.</figcaption>
</figure>
We note the homogenization of the pool region for both $q_2$ and $q_3$ in their respective pool regions.

<h3>Problem 5 (Discussion)</h3>

<p>
We will discuss the results presented mainly in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. 
We begin with the streamfunctions. 
Importantly, we note the decrease in area / region as we move down in the water column. 
This is to say that as the streamfunctions have progressively smaller regions of validity given the demarkations found in the previously questions.
This also corresponds to the total transport decreasing as we go down in the watercolumn. 
Further, we note the $\psi_i$ solution is nearly continuous at the region interfaces, but there is a slight discontinuity.
Additionally, there is a similar form within the pool regions, both in the direction of circulation in the separate gyres as well as the forms of the contours in relation to the contour of the demarkation of the region.
</p>

<p>
Now, we discuss the QGPV. 
Perhaps the largest difference is the pool regions between $q_2$ and  $q_3$ with the larck of one pool region in $q_1$.
There is not a single pool region in $q_1$, as opposed to the large homogenzed QGPV pool within $q_2$ and the smalled homogenized pool of $q_3$.
This then means the shadow region of $q_2$ is smaller than $q_3$. 
Remarkably, demonstrating the strength of this model formulation, we again see the close agreement between the QGPV contours across the interfaces. 
We could, as with $\psi_i$, compare Fig. 10  $q_1$ with Fig. 5 and see a large similarity with only a minor discontinuity. Super cool!
</p>
