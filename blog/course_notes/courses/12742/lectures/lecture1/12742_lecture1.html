<h1>12.742: Lecture 1</h1>
<h2>History of Oceanography</h2>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>A Timeline</h3>

<ol>
<li>HMS Challenger Expedition: 1872-1876</li>
<ul>
<li>A global expedition that was the first of it's kind to study of the ocean</li>
<li>Produced the first map of sea surface density</li>
</ul>
<li>Establishment of WHOI: 1930</li>
<li>World War II: 1939-1945</li>
<ul>
<li>The dawn of modern ocenaography</li>
<li>Produced high resolution maps of the ocean, from bathymetry to currents</li>
</ul>
<li>Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS): 1970s</li>
<li>U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S. JGOFS): Late 1980s</li>
<li>World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE): 1990s</li>
<li>Climate and Ocean Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR): 2000s</li>
<li>Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Programs (GOSHIP): 2010s</li>
<li>An International Study of the Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and Isotopes (GEOTRACES): 2010s</li>
<li>SeaWIFS: 1997 - 2010</li>
<li>MODIS: 2010s - Now</li>
<li>(Bio)-Argo: 2010s - Now</li>
<li>TARA Oceans: 2010s</li>
</ol>

<h3>Geo-context</h3>

We also put this history of oceanography within the context of enslaved peoples within the U.S.'s history.
Modern oceanography developed, as seen in the timeline above, as a discipline in the 19th century with ocean depth sounding and charting of surface currents.
Understanding of these currents and trade winds (note the name) were motivated by improving commercial trade ship navigation. 
On these ships between 18010 and 1860 over 3.5 million enslaved peoples across the Atlantic.

<h3>The Innovators</h3>

Before this section, I would like to note that the list given was all men. 
This is not indicative of current and past ocean science. 
As an addendeum to the presentation given, I would like to highlight:
<ol>
	<li>Maria Mitchell: the first woman to work for the U.S. Coast Survey</li>
	<li>Marie Tharp: discovered the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and proved the validity of continental drift</li>
	<li>Sylvia Earle: pioneering deep water explorer</li>
	<li>Cindy Lee Van Dover: first and only woman to pilot Alvin</li>
</ol>
Some others (as given in the lecture):
<ol>
	<li>Max Blumer: WHOI scientist who started the field of quantitative oil spill science</li>
	<li>Ed Carpenter: WHOI scientist who had the first paper on microplastics in the oceans</li>
	<li>Clair Patterson: Caltech scientist who used lead and its isotopes in remote environments to help pass the Clean Air Act</li>
	<li>Glen Shen and Ed Boyle: MIT scientists who demonstrated the decreases in contaminating lead using corals</li>
</ol>
