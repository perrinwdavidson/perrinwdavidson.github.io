<h3>Phytoplankton Dynamics</h3>

<h4>N-P Model: Bottom Up Limitation</h4>

We can write a model of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{d}P}{\textrm{d}t} = P\cdot\left( v_{\text{max}} \frac{N}{K_N + N} - \lambda_p \right) =_{\text{SS}}0,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_P$ is the death rate. 
We can imagine this is a $\text{growth} - \text{death}$ scenario.
Therefore, we can get:
\begin{equation}
	\lambda_P = \frac{v_{\text{max}}N}{K_N + N}.
\end{equation}
We can rearrange to get the nutrient, as a constant:
\begin{equation}
	N = \frac{\lambda_PK_N}{v_{\text{max}} - \lambda_P}.
\end{equation}
We define the total nutrient as: $N_T = N + P$.
We note that in this steady-state model, $N$ is a constant, as it is a function of constants.
Therefore, we can think of our system as having some total N, $N_T$, for which there is constant offset by $N$ that gives us $P$.
We can define two regimes here. 
The first is when $N$ is very low such that the growth rate from photosynthesis is smaller than the death rate.
Therefore, we would eventually get that $P \to 0$.
However, we we have that $N$ is large enough, then $P$ is supported and we reach a new steady state under the conditions of the system. 
If advection and diffusion come into play, then we need to consider more $N$ to make up for this transport. 
We can think of this solution, lastly, as the maximum value of $N$ that the system will hold, after which all additional $N$ goes into the production of $P$.

<h4>N-P-Z Model: Top Down Limitation</h4>

We can also consider the effect of having top down limitation, i.e, zooplankton eat both $N$ and $P$.
Therefore, this removes the total amount of $N$ within the system.
We present all of this in Fig. 1.
We can continue this to have multiple size classes, which is shown for two size classes for $P$ and $Z$ in the dashed lines in the right panel of Fig. 1.

<h4>Sverdrup's Critical Depth Hypothesis</h4>

Sverdrup posits that the critical MLD is that where the integration of net photosynthesis and net respiration are equation, the compensation depth we discussed previously. 
In this case, we could get that there is enough nutrients from the deep MLD and enough light to have a bloom, which is why we have lots of primary productivity in regions of deep MLD (North Atlantic).
