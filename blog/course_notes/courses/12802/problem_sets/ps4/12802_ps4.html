<h1>12.802: Problem Set 4</h1>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>Problem 1</h3>

We consider a Yanai wave generated in the middle of the equatorial Pacific away from boundaries. 
To begin, we note that the Yanai wave, or the mixed Rossby-gravity wave, is a special case of the solution to the governing equations for equatorial waves:
\begin{equation}
	\partial_x u = -g \partial_x \eta \quad \text{ and } \quad \partial_t \eta + H \partial_x = 0,
\end{equation}
which, after recognizing that the solution required here is of the form, which vanish as $y \to \infty$:
\begin{equation}
	G' = \exp\left[- \frac{1}{2} \frac{\beta y^2}{c}\right] G(x - ct),
\end{equation}
gives the dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
	\omega = kc,
\end{equation}
for $c^2 = gH.$
If we seek solutions of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\exp\left[\text{i}\left( kx - \omega t \right) \right],
\end{equation}
we get the ODE:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{d}^2v}{\textrm{d}y} + \left( \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} - k^2 - \frac{\beta k}{\omega} - \frac{\beta^2y^2}{c^2}\right)v = 0.
\end{equation}
From this, and taking the solutions that vanish as $y \to \pm \infty$, we get the dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
	\left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 - k^2 - \frac{\beta k}{\omega} = \frac{\left( 2n +1 \right)\beta }{c}.
\end{equation} 

<p>
<b>(a)</b> 
So, from the above general equatorial wave dispersion relation, and noting that the Yanai wave is defined as that wave defined for $n=0$, we get the Yanai dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\omega}{c} - l - \frac{\beta}{\omega} = 0.
\end{equation}
From Gill [1982], we note that solutions to this special case are:
\begin{align}
	v = \exp\left[-\frac{\beta y^2}{2c}\right]\cos\left[kx - \omega t\right], \\
	u = -\left( \frac{\omega y}{c} \right) \exp\left[- \frac{\beta y^2}{2c}\right] \sin\left[kx - \omega t\right],
\end{align} 
noting that the zonal velocity is odd in $y$ about the equator and is not in geostrophic balance, most so at the equator which decreases as $y^2$ increases.
The Yanai wave is unique in that for large positive $k$ it behaves like a gravity, but for negative $k$ is behaves like a planetary wave.
Thus, this leads to it's alternative name, the <i>mixed Rossby-gravity wave</i>.
The phase velocity can be east to west, but the group velocity is always eastward, as it is the maximum of short waves with eastward group velocities, that is for all gravity waves.
The corresponding particles have anticyclonic orbits everywhere.

<h3>Problem 3</h3>

We consider a two-layer model in the mid-latitudes with the top layer of thickness $H_1 = 1000$ [m] and the bottom layer of thickness $H_2 = 3000$ [m].
The density difference $\Delta \rho$ between these two layers has been chosen so that the baroclinic Kelvin wave speed is $c_\text{Kelvin} = 3$ [m s$^{-1}$].
For this problem, we are interested in calculating the spin-up time, $t_{s}$, for a range of scenarios. 
The initial scenario is, given the properties stated above, that $t_{s,0} = 20$ [y].
Let's assume that the horizontal domain is of length $L$.
For all of these scenarios that follow, we note that $t_s$ is defined as the time it takes for the slowest Rossby wave to propogate from the eastern to the western boundary, that is the distance $L$.

<p><b>(a)</b> 
Now, we want to determine what $t_s$ is given that the horizontal domain has doubled in size. 
To do so, we could simply note the linear relation between the distance propogated and the spin up time, that is:
\begin{equation}
	t_s = \frac{L}{c_\text{Rossby}}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, if we let $L \to 2L$, this then means that $t_s \to 2t_{s,0}$. Thus, we get that, for this scenario:
\begin{equation}
	t_s = 40 \: \left[\text{y}\right].
\end{equation}
Now, we can come at this from a second angle by first recalling the Kelvin wave dispersion relation from <b>1</b>:
\begin{equation}
	\omega = kc,
\end{equation}
where we define:
\begin{equation}
	c^2 = g'H^\ast,
\end{equation}
for $g$ reduced gravitational acceleration defined as:
\begin{equation}
	g' = g\frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_2} \simeq g \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_0}
\end{equation}
and $H^\ast$ the effect depth of the layer of interest defined as:
\begin{equation}
	H^\ast = \frac{H_1H_2}{H_1 + H_2}.
\end{equation}
We note here that we assume that we assume the reference density is greater than the density anomaly, i.e., $\sigma_2 \ll \rho_0$ for $\rho_2 = \rho_0+\sigma_2$.
Therefore, we can get the phase velocity as:
\begin{equation}
	c_\text{Kelvin} = \frac{\omega}{k} = c = g \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_0}\frac{H_1H_2}{H_1 + H_2}.
\end{equation}
As we are given $c_{\text{Kelvin}}$, we can solve for $\Delta \rho = \rho_2 - \rho_1$ as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \rho = \frac{c_{\text{Kelvin}}\rho_0}{g'H^\ast},
\end{equation}
which then allows us to calculate $g'$.
Next, we want to calculate $c_\text{Rossby}$ for the two layer model, for the baroclinic mode. 
To do this, we can cite Gill [1982] (as deriving the following relations is, I think, most likely outside the scope of this problem set), and define the line dividing eastward- and westward-propagating waves (for group velocity) as the hyperbola:
\begin{equation}
	k^2 = l^2 + f_0^2 / c^2.
\end{equation}
Then, we can cite Problem Set 3 (or Vallis [2006]) to get the Rossby wave dispersion relation for an infinite deformation radius:
\begin{equation}
	\omega = \frac{\beta k}{k^2 + l^2}.
\end{equation}
Noting that we can deal with only zonal motion, we then get, for the relation for the horizontal wave number above, that the group velocity for the baroclinic Rossby waves in this model is given by:
\begin{equation}
	c_\text{Rossby} = \frac{\beta}{l^2 + f_0^2 / c^2}.
\end{equation}
Now, we can note that, for baroclinic modes, $l^2 \ll f_0^2 / c^2$, giving:
\begin{equation}
	c_\text{Rossby} \simeq \frac{\beta}{f_0^2 / c^2}.
\end{equation}
So, after all of that, we can get that, for this present scenario of interest:
\begin{equation}
	t_s = \frac{2L}{c_\text{Rossby}} = \frac{2L f_0^2}{\beta g'H^\ast} \simeq 40 \left[\text{y}\right].
\end{equation}
</p>

<p><b>(b)</b>
Now, we want to calculate the new $t_s'$ when we have reduced $\Delta \rho = 0$, that is we are now dealing with a single-layer, homogenous model of depth $H = 4000$ [m].
To do this, we first want to calculate the length of the domain, $L$. 
We can rearrange our equations above to get:
\begin{equation}
	L = t_s\frac{\beta g' H^\ast}{f_0^2}.
\end{equation}
Then, we note that, as we have seen in lecture:
\begin{equation}
	c_\text{Rossby} \sim \Delta \rho.
\end{equation}
Therefore, for our equation for $t_s$ above, we would get:
\begin{equation}
t_s' \xrightarrow[\Delta \rho \to 0]{} \infty,
\end{equation}
as $g' \sim \Delta \rho$, which is in the denominator of our current definition of $t_s'$. 
Clearly, this is aphysical, but we can arrive a physical solution by first noting that the first baroclinic mode occurs when waves at the <i>interface</i> of two layers have opposite phase. 
Therefore, we cannot have a baroclinic mode in a single layer model when we assume that there is a solid (flat) bottom boundary and thus only one free surface. 
This then implies that we are dealing with a barotropic mode, which changes the game a bit. 

<p>
In the barotopic mode, we have the opposite inequality of the baroclinic in the denominator of our Rossby phase velocity. 
Namely, we have that $l^2 \gg f_0^2 / c^2$.
Therefore, our updated Rossby phase velocity is:
\begin{equation}
	c_\text{Rossby} \simeq \frac{\beta}{l^2},
\end{equation}
which from Gill [1982] has values of $\mathcal{O}\left( 200 \right) $ [m s$^{-1}$].
We will use this as a sanity check for our updated Rossby velocity, in which, as we have one model, we now let $g' \to  g$ and $H^\ast \to H = H_1 + H_2$, giving:
\begin{equation}
c_\text{Rossby} = \frac{\beta g H}{f_0^2} \simeq 198 \left[\text{m s}^{-1}\right]
\end{equation}
which is on the order of our value from above.
Therefore, we have that the spin-up in this scenario is given by:
\begin{equation}
	t_s' = \frac{L f_0^2}{\beta g H} \simeq 1.67 \left[\text{d}\right].
\end{equation}
This is 3 orders of magnitude quicker than our solution to <b>(a)</b>, but then again so was our Rossby wave velocity...
