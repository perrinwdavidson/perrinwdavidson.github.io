<h1>Deriving the Equations of Motion for a Liquid on a Rotating Sphere</h1>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
<p>
From any physics course, we know that Newton's Second Law for a parcel $P$ contained within our reference frame $R$ can be stated as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},
\end{equation}
where we have that $\mathbf{F}$ is the sum of all forces acting on $P$ with units [M][D][T]$^{-2} \sim $ [N], $m$ is the mass of $P$, and $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration of $P$. \par

Now, for $P$ finite-sized (say a box of size $V$ still with mass $m$), then we are good to use this formulation.
However, we are interested in discretizing our fluid into volumes of infinitesimal size, $\textrm{d}V$. 
Defining the density of $P$ to be $\rho$, we note here that $\rho V = m$, so we can update Newton's equation to be, taking $P$ now to be infinitesimal (and thus $V \to \textrm{d}V \to 0$):
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F} = \rho \mathbf{a}\textrm{d}V.
\end{equation}
We can redefine our sum of forces as $\mathbf{\tilde{F}}=\mathbf{F}/\textrm{d}V \sim $ [N][D]$^{-3}$ and therefore get the updated Newton's Second Law for a Fluid Parcel as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\tilde{F}} = \rho \mathbf{a}.
\end{equation}
Next, we need to think about all of the forces that are acting on $P$. 
The ones that we will consider here are: the pressure gradient force, the viscous force, and the gravitational force:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\tilde{F}} = \mathbf{\tilde{F}}_p + \mathbf{\tilde{F}}_v + \mathbf{\tilde{F}}_g = \rho \mathbf{a}.
\end{equation}
I will briefly go through these forces now:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Pressure Gradient:</b> As $P$ is ``pushed'' from higher to lower pressures $(p\sim$ [N][D]$^{-2})$, we can write this as: \[
			\mathbf{\tilde{F}}_p = - \nabla p
			.\] 
	</li>
	<li> <b>Viscous:</b> We can represent a fluid's resistance to deformation by something like a momentum diffusion process (similar to Fick's Second Law applied to momentum instead of concentration):
		\[
			\mathbf{\tilde{F}}_v = \mu \nabla ^2 \mathbf{u}
		,\]
		where $\mu\sim$ [N][T][D]$^{-2}$ is dynamic viscosity.
	</li>
	<li> <b>Gravitational:</b> The force of a planetary body's gravity pulling $P$ toward it's centre is given by:
		 \[
			 \mathbf{\tilde{F}}_g = -\rho g\mathbf{\hat{k}} = -\rho\nabla \Phi_g,
		\]
		where we define $\Phi_g \sim $ [D]$^2$[T]$^{-2}$ to be the gravitational potential of the body.
	</li>
</ul>
Now, we note that acceleration of $P$ can be given by the material derivative:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{a} = \frac{\textrm{D}\mathbf{u}}{\textrm{D}t} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla\mathbf{u}. 
\end{equation}
Next, we need to deal with our reference frame $R$, specifically that we are in a non-inertial reference frame  (i.e., our fluid is on a sphere, spinning).
Therefore, we need to develop some theory to help in accurately describing motion in this reference frame. 
To do this, let's define vectors $\in \mathbb{R}^2: \mathbf{f}=[f_1,f_2, f_3]^T$ and $\mathbf{g}=[g_1, g_2,g_3]^T$ spanned by $[\mathbf{\hat{\imath}},\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}},\mathbf{\hat{k}}]^T$.
We now will relate each through a rotation of $\theta$, assuming that one is in an inertial reference frame and one a non-interial, rotating reference frame:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{f}= \begin{bmatrix} \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\ \cos \theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where we here related those vectors specifically spanned by $\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}}$.
