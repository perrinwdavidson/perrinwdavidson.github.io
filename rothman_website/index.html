	  <p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
	  Physical laws are simple, yet the natural world is beautifully complex.  
	  How did that happen?
          I seek the foundations of environmental complexity.  
	  <a href="https://www.mit.edu">MIT's</a> <a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/">Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences</a>, my group's academic home, provides an abundant source of fascinating problems.  
	  We work in the <a href="https://www.lorenz.mit.edu">Lorenz Center</a>, which encourages creative thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the fundamental understanding of climate.
	  </p>
	  <p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
	  Roughly half our work is related to understanding the interaction of life and the environment, while the other half is purely physical, with an emphasis on fluid mechanics.  
	  In all cases we focus on dynamics and seek the reconciliation of mathematical and physical theory with observations.  
	  The following brief list describes some areas of sustained interest over the last several years.  
	  To learn more about current interests, check our most recent publications or contact us for more information.
	  </p>
	  <ul style="margin-bottom: -1em">
		  <li style="margin-bottom: -1em"><b>Earth's carbon cycle: </b>
		   Earth's carbon cycles through the atmosphere, oceans, living organisms, and rocks.  
		   How does the carbon cycle work?  
		   The problem ostensibly falls at the intersection of earth science, biology, and chemistry.  
		   However, observations spanning a wide range of environments and biogeochemical transformations exhibit common features suggesting that simple physical mechanisms exert significant control.  
		   We seek a fundamental understanding of these physical processes and explore their relevance to present and past environmental change. 
		  </li>
		  <br>
		  <li style="margin-bottom: -1em"><b>Co-evolution of life and the environment:</b>
	  	  The geologic record suggests that major events in the history life nearly always occur concurrently with environmental change.  
		  To understand how and why these changes occur, we study the geochemical, fossil, and molecular records and relate them to environmental dynamics.  
		  We are especially interested in the early oxygenation of the environment, the evolution of multicellular life, and mass extinctions. 
		  </li>
		  <br>
		  <li><b>Geometry of natural forms:</b>
	  	   The natural world contains abundant examples of geometric organization.  
		   We seek the mathematical expression of such forms and shapes and relate them to the physical mechanisms responsible for their formation.  
		   A particularly rich set of problems occurs in the growth of valley and river networks, for which the physics of flow and diffusion yield precise, verifiable predictions.  
		   We are particularly interested in developing a comprehensive understanding of the ramification of stream networks.  
		   Some of our recent work has also focused on mechanisms of biofilm growth and their relation to the geometry of Earth's earliest fossils and the environmental conditions responsible for their formation.

		  <li style="margin-bottom: 1em"><b><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/12-086-modeling-environmental-complexity-fall-2014/">12.086/12.586 Modeling Environmental Complexity:</a></b>
		This course provides an introduction to the study of environmental phenomena that exhibit both organized structure and wide variability--i.e., complexity. 
		Through focused study of a variety of physical, biological, and chemical problems in conjunction with theoretical models, students learn a series of lessons with wide applicability to understanding the structure and organization of the natural world. 
		Students also learn how to construct minimal mathematical, physical, and computational models that provide informative answers to precise questions. 
		Open to both undergraduate and graduate students.
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom: -1em"><b><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/12-006j-nonlinear-dynamics-chaos-fall-2022/">12.006J/18.353J/2.050J Nonlinear Dynamics: Chaos:</a></b>
		This undergraduate course provides an introduction to the theory and phenomenology of nonlinear dynamics and chaos. 
		Offered first by the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in 1989, and later jointly with the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 
		The course continues to be taught by others, and remains popular.  
		Course materials, including detailed lecture notes, are available through MIT's Open Courseware.

	 	This undergraduate course provides students with an understanding of the mechanisms that underly the organization of the natural environment. 
		It also introduces students to methods of quantitative analysis that are useful for investigating how any system works. 
		The course teaches students how to identify fundamental phenomena, how to formulate theoretical models, and how to quantitatively test models by comparison to observations. 
		A secondary but no less important objective is to provide students with a unified view of environmental science by emphasizing aspects of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences that collectively act to create the natural environment, both physical and biological.  
		Offered jointly by the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and the Department of Mathematics.
