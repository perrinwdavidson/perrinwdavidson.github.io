	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #750014; margin: 5px 0">
	<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
	My current interests focus on the ways in which biology and physics interact to create and maintain our environment. 
	For example, how do global biogeochemical cycles arise and evolve? 
	Are they stable? 
	Do they impact the stability of climate? 
	Microbes hold sway over biogeochemical cycles, yet most merely persist while starving. 
	How can they exert so much control while doing so little? 
	Such questions are hard to answer, in part because of the apparent need to know too much about too many things. 
	Yet there are hints of underlying order, and I seek to reveal it.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
	I am a theoretical scientist. 
	Most of my work involves mathematics, and it is all informed by the perspectives of statistical and nonlinear physics. 
	I nevertheless have a strong interest in observational and experimental data and the extent to which they conform with theory.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
	Perhaps the most important unsolved problem in climate science is whether and how the Earth system–life and the physical environment–can become unstable. 
	Interactions with the carbon cycle are surely an essential part of this picture. 
	The great climatic and carbon-cycle disruptions of the geological past, including those associated with mass extinction, provide suggestions of instabilities. 
	I’m particularly interested in the possibility that “tipping points” may be surpassed when a parameter, such as CO2 levels, changes faster than a critical rate. 
	Mass extinctions appear to be the most important manifestation of such a mechanism. 
	Theory and data support this interpretation, but much remains unclear. 
	The implications of these findings for the long-term risks modern environmental change present a fascinating question.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
	I’ve long suspected that inbalances within the carbon cycle are possible not only because of external perturbations (e.g., human activity) but also microbial dynamics. 
	Microbes, after all, are responsible for a large fraction of global respiration. 
	But how might such inbalances occur? 
	We first need to understand the mechanisms that underlie the organization of microbial life and the ways in which this organization interacts with the cycling of carbon. 
	Observational data points to an extraordinary manifestation of temporal scale invariance. 
	My recent work shows how this occurs and how it impacts the organization of the global carbon cycle and the abundance of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. 
	The ultimate implications likely lie even deeper.

		This course provides an introduction to the study of environmental phenomena that exhibit both organized structure and wide variability--i.e., complexity. 
		Through focused study of a variety of physical, biological, and chemical problems in conjunction with theoretical models, students learn a series of lessons with wide applicability to understanding the structure and organization of the natural world. 
		Students also learn how to construct minimal mathematical, physical, and computational models that provide informative answers to precise questions. 
		Open to both undergraduate and graduate students.
