<i>what's this all about you say?</i> hahaha well, we're gonna be hanging out and rocking out for an evening to celebrate a few things:
<ol>
  <li> <b>birds:</b> zebra finches to be exact. just look at these things: 
       <p class="center_text"><img src="birds.jpeg" alt="Portrait" height="250"></p>
       they sing, and hopefully we can take a card from these aviators' deck for the evening. 
  </li>
  <li> <b>bubbles:</b> you ever thought about multiphase flow, lattice gas cellular automata, or this nonsense: 
       \[\frac{p_V(T_\infty) - p_\infty(t)}{\rho_L} + \frac{p_{G_o}}{\rho_L}\left(\frac{R_o}{R}\right)^{3k} = R\ddot{R} + \frac{3}{2}(\dot{R})^2 + \frac{4\nu_L\dot{R}}{R} + \frac{2S}{\rho_LR} ?\]
       yeah... me either. but bubbles are part of a few of my favorite things: parties, alcoholic beverages, and gas exchange (haha).  
  </li>
  <li> <b>bayes:</b> we like working under the thought that life's probabilitistic not deterministic, i mean you can't say you don't agree with this statement:
        \[P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}.\]
        just think about all the alternate universes – so many possibilities, just like there will be for this night.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
it's also a birthday party, but that's really not that important. check back for more updates.
