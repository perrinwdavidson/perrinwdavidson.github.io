but perhaps this time around it is. 
or james murphy was wrong?
come find out at 211 allston for val's 5th annual 25th birthday x 10.
its cambridgeport's hottest club and its got it all !!!
whether u have danced ur ass off in central before---or ur like val and it goes on for days---come celebrate our friend who certainly doesnt live here anymore and also thinks we should plan this party yesterday.
she further requests 250$ per person. 
thats 1$ a year for every year shes lived.
