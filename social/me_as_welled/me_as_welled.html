The worst form of solitude is the company of a grad student. 
That Phoebe, having escaped their ranks, would choose to return to Cambridge, MA–<i>where they make them</i>—shows that some mistakes are just too precious not to repeat.

To get through her first stay, she reminded herself of home the only ways she knew. 
Eating marmite. 
Larping as Jane Austen characters in the Harvard English department. 
Referring to #MeToo as #MeAsWell.  
Now that she’s back, we hope she might come to love the city as one loves hand-me-downs: not through affinity but through constancy and shared experience. 
Come give her a warm welcome into her new home.
