...or at least my attempt at one, enough to make u all think i read. 
we start in chicago, november 2017, prlly somethin "alt" was spinning on a record player, like the nationals extended edition cut of terrible love (lol, but srsly it is a better track). 
no snow. 
no sleighs on the way to grandma's house. 
it was unseasonally warm and a maine boy (thats me) found himself in a cityscape void of that thanksgiving charm vacationland (THE WAY LIFE SHOULD BE) dishes out on most november days. 
one bright day he decided to fix this and went on the hunt for a turkey and ended up in the aisles of a tjs. 
rumor has it u can still find him there, around this time every year. 
</p>
<p>
for the 2023 edition, come join that same boy (still me) with a new bird (a turkey to be precise, and a very friendly neighbors working oven. both things can be true: you can cook a turkey in the oven and you cannot.) along with some other classics. 
and im not talkin about my roommates (tho theyre SOLID). 
we're talkin:
<ol>
<li>mashed potatoes</li>
<li>scalloped potatoes</li>
<li>squash (various kinds)</li>
<li>green bean casserole</li>
<li>stuffing</li>
<li>cranberry sauce</li>
<li>gravy</li>
<li>more potatoes</li>
</ol>
but dont worry: u can join in on the fun, too, cause its a potluck OF COURSE.
</p>
<p>
so come 1 come call.
im lookin forward to eeeet.
