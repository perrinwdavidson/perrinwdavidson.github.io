...or at least my attempt at one, enough to make u all think i read. 
we start in chicago, november 2017.
prlly somethin "alt" was spinning on a record player, like the nationals extended edition cut of terrible love (lol. but srsly it is a better track). 
<ul>
<li>no snow.</li>
<li>no sleighs on the way to grandma's house.</li>
</ul>
it was unseasonably warm and a maine boy (thats me) found himself in a cityscape void of that thanksgiving charm vacationland (THE WAY LIFE SHOULD BE) dishes out on most november days. 
so, he set out to fix this and went on the hunt for a turkey, ending up in the aisles of a tjs. 
rumor has it u can still find him there round this time every year. 
</p>
<p>
for the 2023 edition, come join that same boy (still me) with a new bird (a turkey to be precise, and a very friendly neighbors working oven. both things can be true: you can cook a turkey in the oven and you cannot.) along with some other classics. 
and im not talkin about my roommates (tho theyre SOLID). 
we're talkin:
<ol>
<li>mashed potatoes</li>
<li>scalloped potatoes</li>
<li>squash (various kinds)</li>
<li>green bean casserole</li>
<li>stuffing</li>
<li>cranberry sauce</li>
<li>gravy</li>
<li>more potatoes</li>
</ol>
but dont worry: u can join in on the fun, too, cause its a potluck OF COURSE.
</p>
<p>
so come 1 come all.
im lookin forward to eeeet.
</p>
<p>
<b>update 02.12.23:</b> okay so some ppl were wondering about things to bring. 
if it were me, id bring alc of some kind (ur favorite kind preferably) or a desert-adjacent dish. 
but honestly like just bring whatever u want. its all appreciated.
for more planning purposes, im making the following, which are veggie unless otherwise noted:
<ul>
<li>turkey (NOT veggie)</li>
<li>stuffing</li>
<li>mashed potatoes</li>
<li>mashed sweet potatoes</li>
<li>roasted root vegetables</li>
<li>scalloped potatoes</li>
<li>mashed butternut squash</li>
<li>cranberry sauce</li>
<li>roasted brussels sprouts</li>
<li>roasted acorn squash</li>
</ul>
so if ur favorite dish isnt on here, id bring that (the green bean casserole scares me so imma pass this year). see u all tmo
