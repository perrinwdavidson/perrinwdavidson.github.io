<h2>as a wise man once said:</h2>
<h1>"i'll explain everything to the geeks!"</h1>

while the lyrics exact meaning may never be known, scholars have posited a range of interpretations:
<ol>
	<li>
	berninger was mistaken and in fact meant “geese”, a clear reference to his fleeting relationship with fame from which he is always running, much like a goose and winter. 
	</li>
	<li>
	the sad dads were subtly introducing the hitherto unknown geese-geek binary: viz, one either knows as much as a geek or a little as a silly little goose. 
	</li>
	<li>
	@greengloves777 was examining the polysemy of “geeks”, thereby asserting that while geeks may grasp deeply a spectrum of arcane specialties, they in fact know nothing of the real world. 
	in so doing, he is instantiating an attack on the whole of camberville and the grad students doing their silly little goose things that reside there.  
	</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
and that’s the dialectic. 
</p>
<p>
or our party's theme.
</p>
<p>
either will do. 
</p>

<p>
regardless, let’s consider all the birthdays that have come before and all those yet to come and stay warm together in the comfort of allston st, like a nice goose-down jacket.
</p>

<p>
n.b.: while it might not seem like it, this is indeed a birthday party for three residents of cambridgeport spread across two homes. 
so come one, come all, and be ready to have a good time.
