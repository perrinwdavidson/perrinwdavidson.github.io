<b>update [0908 on 24.02.24]:</b>
<ul>
  <li> we're starting around 2000 (note the time change. I was just informed, for the second year in a row, that I'm quote "not a club") tonight and going until late, but show up whenevever </li>
  <li> it's byob-adjacent (take that as you will) </li>
  <li> bring your friends, anyone and everyone is welcome </li>
</ul>
</p>

seems like the past year has been about one thing: the dopamine delta. 
its surprisingly not a lyric to a national song, just how im feeling now (though i like to think that berninger–or aitchison for that matter–could have come up with that). 
you know, the cliche highs-and-lows, life is a highway, rollercoaster kind-of thing, just cast in a cantabrigian way. 
</p>
<p>
another way we can think about this would be to define an equation for life happiness, such as
$$\mathcal{F}\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{F}\mathcal{A}^\gamma \quad \text{ where } \quad \gamma \in \mathbb{R}_+,$$
where we let \(\gamma\) be the "fuck-around strength." 
we can then define the total finding-out as
$$\mathcal{T}\mathcal{F}\mathcal{O} = \int_0^a \mathcal{F}\mathcal{A}^\gamma \mathrm{d}\mathcal{F}\mathcal{A},$$
where \(a\) is defined as the "discovery terminus."
then, the point of life is to just find which \(\gamma, a\) lead to a sustainable dopamine delta, \(\Delta_d\).
</p>
<p>
so regardless of whether ur more antonoff or rascal flats, im tryna start off 25 on 24 by uncovering the optimal \(\gamma\) and \(a\). 
come on by, say hi, and help me in this pursuit if ur around.
