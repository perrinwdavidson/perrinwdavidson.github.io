things recently have been... unbearable---unbearable---but someone told me they used to be much worse. 
so perhaps we remember the good through the bad, regardless of the fact that none of us can be bruce vilanch, and come together for a night of well-mannered frivolity (tho no promises jonny will show up). 
we can be the custodians of boston's favorite micro-neighborhood of cambridgeport together, becoming pennys to the big apple's dimes. 
let's then settle for being michael musto and eat it, turkey that is. 
for planning purposes im making the following, which are veggie unless otherwise noted:
<ul>
	<li>turkey (with the bird and all def NOT veggie)</li>
	<li>stuffing (this may or may not have bacon in it. depends on how im feeling sunday)</li>
	<li>mashed potatoes</li>
	<li>mashed sweet potatoes</li>
	<li>roasted root vegetables</li>
	<li>scalloped potatoes</li>
	<li>cranberry sauce</li>
	<li>roasted brussels sprouts</li>
	<li>roasted acorn squash</li>
	<li>mulled cider</li>
	<li>glühwein</li>
</ul>
per usual: plz add to this list as u see fit, invite ur friends, and lets FEAST !
