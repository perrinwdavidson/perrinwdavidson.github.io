    <h1>Hey, I'm Perrin.</h1>

    <p>
      I'm an undergraduate at the University of Chicago where I am working toward a B.A. in Physics with Honors and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, I work under Professor David Archer in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at UChicago and under Dr. Ken O. Buesseler and Dr. Roo Nicholson at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
      In both labs, I work to develop data-constrained oceanographic models using statistical and physical techniques. 
      Specifically, I am interested in utilizing the strengths from both observational and theoretical practices by combining machine learning with inverse and computational modeling to elucidate the stability and critical tipping points of the biological pump and the carbon cycle generally.

    <p> 
      In my work, I commonly come back to the statistics aphorism attributed to George E. P. Box
      <blockquote cite="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00442.x">
        <i>"All models are wrong, but some are useful."</i>
      </blockquote>
      It is therefore my job as an aspiring ocean modeler to make all my models useful. I mean, who wants a worthless model? I certainly don't...
