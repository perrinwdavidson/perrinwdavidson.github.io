	About
    </h2>
    <p>
	Hey, I'm Perrin. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Chicago (UChicago) where I am working toward a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. in Physics, graduating in June 2022. That same month I start as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). There, I will be developing theoretical and numerical dynamical models of the marine carbon cycle with Dr. Daniel Rothman at MIT. I will also be designing inversion/data assimilation schemes of noble gas tracers to constrain the global ocean heat budget with Dr. Alan Seltzer and Dr. David Nicholson at WHOI.

	Research Interests

    <p>
      Currently, I work under Professor David Archer in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at UChicago and under Dr. Ken O. Buesseler and Dr. Roo Nicholson at WHOI. 
      In both labs, I work to develop data-constrained oceanographic models.
      Specifically, I am interested in utilizing the strengths from both observational and theoretical practices by combining machine learning with inverse and computational modeling to elucidate the stability and critical tipping points of the biological pump and the carbon cycle. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      In my work, I commonly come back to the statistics aphorism attributed to George E. P. Box:
      <blockquote cite="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00442.x">
        <i>"All models are wrong, but some are useful."</i>
      </blockquote>
      It is therefore my job as an aspiring ocean modeler to make all my models useful. I mean, who wants a worthless model? I certainly don't...
