<h1>12.742: Lecture 5</h1>
<h2>Primary Production I</h2>

<hr style="width: 60em;">

<h3>What is Primary Production?</h3>

We define primary production as the production of primary carbon, an autotrophic process. 
This is opposed to secondary and nth-dary production, which converts from this or the (n-1)st-dary production to that level.
We care about this because it is fundamental to the nutrient cycle and is central to the carbon cycle (uptake and sequestration). 
As we discussed in the last lecture, we note that there is more food in the surface ocean. 

<h3>Nutrients</h3>

We go over important nutrients no:
<ul>
<li>Nitrogen</li>
<ul>
<li>N$_2$: Nitrogen gas, which is mostly in the atmosphere (75%) with an oxidation state of 0. We note that there is a triple bond here, so it is super hard to break.</li>
<li>NO$_3^{-}$: Nitrate, which has an oxidation state of +5, herefore the most oxidized state of N, which means it is the most abundant form in the ocean as the ocean is well oxygenated.</li>
<li>NH$_4^+ \leftrightharpoons$ NH$_3$: Ammonium and Ammonia, for which the equilibrium is driven by pH and in the ocean the dominant form is Ammonium, which has an oxidation state of +3. It is the most favoured of the N compounds.</li>
</ul>
<li>Iron</li>
<ul>
<li>Fe$^{2+}$: Much more soluble in Fe$^{3+}$. The balance between these two (soluble and oxidized) and a major balance in the ocean, which organisms like siderophores help balance out.</li>
<li>Fe$^{3+}$ As iron oxidation is very quick, this is the major constituent in the ocean.</li>
</ul>
<li>Phosphorous</li>
<ul>
<li>
PO$_4^{3-}$: Phosphate. Here, really what we are talking about is the equilibrium of the following species, which is pH dependent:
\begin{equation}
\text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{HPO}_4^{2-} + \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^{-} + \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4.
\end{equation}
</li>
</ul>
<li>Carbon:</li>
<ul>
<li>CO$_2$: fixed by RuBisCo, which turns carbon dioxide into carbonate. Very little in the ocean, given equilibrium.</li>
<li>HCO$_3^-$: Bicarbonate, about 90% of the ocean DIC</li>
<li>CO$_3^{2-}$: Carbonate ion, about 10% of the ocean DIC</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Important things to note here is that when we say phosphate, we mean the sum of all protentated forms, as this is a simple acid-base reaction that is pH dependent (as stated before). This means that the relative abundances are all the same order.
However, in the case of iron and nitrogen (DIN), it is a set of redox reactions which are more complicated and  therefore there are orders of magnitude differences between all these form which cause us to separate out their relative abundances.

<h4>Oxidation States</h4>

The oxidation state is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic (transfer of valence electron causing opposite charge attraction).
It describes the degree of oxidation (the loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound.
The most favoured oxidation state for the nutrients discussed above is that which has the same oxidation state as that needed for the creation of organic material.

<h4>Carbonate Speciation</h4>
The following set of equations govern carbonate equilibrium:
\begin{align}
	\text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} &\leftrightharpoons \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \\
	\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 &\leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^- \\
	\text{HCO}_3^- &\leftrightharpoons H^+ + \text{CO}_3^{2-}
	
\end{align}

<h3>Redfield Ratio</h3>

We have the following equation governing the equilibrium of photosynthesis:
\begin{equation}
	106\text{CO}_2 + 16 \text{HNO}_3 + \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 + 122\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightharpoons \left( \text{CH}_2\text{O} \right)_{106}\left( \text{NH}_3 \right)_16\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 + 138\text{O}_2. 
\end{equation}
Summing all of this, we get something like:
\begin{equation}
	\text{C}_{106}\text{H}_{263}\text{O}_{110}\text{N}_{16}\text{P},
\end{equation}
however the exact values for H and O are highly underconstrained.
The currently preferred ratio is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{C}_{106}\text{H}_{175}\text{O}_{42}\text{N}_{16}\text{P}.
\end{equation}
This is the Anderson (1995) formulation.
We can add in the micronutrients:
\begin{equation}
	(\text{C}_{106}\text{H}_{175}\text{O}_{42}\text{N}_{16}\text{P})_{1000}\text{Fe}_5\text{Zn}_2(\text{Cu, Mn, Ni, Co, Cd})_{0.4}\text{Mo}_{0.1}.
\end{equation}
These metals are important because they can act as co-factors in enzymatic reactions, such as Zn for carbonic anhydrase (which modlates the carbonate equilibrium) and Ni is used for cleaving the nitrogen out of urea to form ammonium.
This is an idealized ratio.
This is all for "soft tissue", but for "hard tissue", we need:
<ul>
<li>Si: diatoms</li>
<li>CaCO$_3$: coccolithophores</li>
</ul>
We can look at this between N:P in Fig. 1.
<figure>
	<img src="images/ntop.png" style="width:60%">
	<figcaption> Fig. 1: An example of the Redfield Ration with N:P, where we note that it is an N limited regime. The colorbar of the inset is for residence time, with red being a 10,000 [kyr] residence time. It is also a log-log plot.</figcaption>
</figure>
There are a few fundamental things we can draw from this figure.
First, we note that this is generally "you are what you eat".
Second, this is not the line of best fit, the 16:1 line and if you were to use RMA or another orthoganol, non-least squares fit (as you should for all data in which the independent variable has inherent uncertainty), you would get a slope between 14 and 15.
However, the line of best fit does not represent just the composition of the OM, which we care about, but also other processes. 
Third, we note that this shows we are in a N limiting environment, given that the $y$-intercept is negative.
Fourth, we note the vectors along the line, with the upward movement to be respiration and the downward movement to be photosynthesis. 
This is because of how we consume N and P with our governing equation above.

<p>
We note that the source of phosphates into the ocean is from weathering, the dissolution apetites. 
The general source of nitrogen in the ocean is nitrogen fixation, which is from the atmosphere. 
We note that this is a decoupling of the sources. 
Therefore, we can say that the reason we have the amount of the N in the ocean is from biology and the amount of P is from geology.
So, this is a very dynamic system based on numerous factors, this is to say that biology affects geology and vice versa, on timescales long enough.
This then gets to the fundamental fact that organisms today were optimized through evolution for the environments in which they were evolved. 
Therefore, remnants from the past are still here within the cellular framework, despite the fact that what is available has changed.
</p>

In the inset of Fig. 1, we see that all trace elements are pretty well constrained in log-log space to the N:P ratio.
The deviations from this line in favour the cells has to do with the evolution of the organism, that is that the environment in which they were evolved had different compositions than the modern ocean.
Originally, the ocean did not have as much oxygen as it has now, rather Fe was more relatively abundant.
So, organisms evolved to use that Fe, and then the conditions of the ocean changed by the physiology of the organisms did not.
We can see this in RuBisCo, which is not greater at fixing carbon dioxide when there is oxygen but when oxygen is around it has a higher affinity for the O$_2$ than the CO$_2$, given that it only evolved once.
This is why carbonic anhydrase is so important so as to concentrate the carbon for biological processes to take place.
We can see that the major constituents of seawater, which are semi-conservative, are not needed as much for the cells, given the conditions in which these cells evolved.

<p>
We can list the top % constituents of cell mass:
<ol>
	<li>Protein: 30 to 65%</li>
	<li>Lipids: 10 to 50%</li>
	<li>Carbohydrates: 5 to 45%</li>
	<li>Phosphoglycerides: 5 to 15%</li>
	<li>RNA: 3 to 15%</li>
	<li>DNA: 0.5 to 3%</li>
	<li>Chlorophyll: 0.2 to 5%</li>
</ol>
These ratios change for growth, for cell types (pro- vs eu-karyotes).
</p>

<h3>The Photo-Respiration Balance</h3>

We can represent the exchange between photosynthesis and respiration as:
\begin{equation}
	\text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightharpoons^A_B \text{CH}_2\text{O} + \text{O}_2,
\end{equation}
where we have simplified our OM from before to CH$_2$O, which is not perfect but not a terrible approximation.
This basically assumes that everything in OM is sugar.
We have the following definitions of productivity:
<ul>
<li>Gross Primary Productivity: $A$</li>
<li>Net Primary Production: $A - B$</li>
<li>Net Community Production: $A - (B + C)$, where $C$ is the pathway between CH$_2$O to CO$_2$.</li>
<li>Export: $D$, the amount of CH$_2$O that is exported to the deep ocean, below the euphotic zone.</li>
</ul>
From this, at steady state, we have to that (A)NCP = Export, as everything that isn't used up in the surface ocean has to be exported, by mass conversation.

<h3>Limitation</h3>

We have the following definitions:
<ul>
<li>Bottom-Up</li>
<ul>
<li>Nutrients</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>CO$_2$? (Think of a bloom)</li>
</ul>
<li>Top-Down</li>
<ul>
<li>Zooplankton</li>
<li>Viruses (Think of a bloom, again...)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
