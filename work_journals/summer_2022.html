	    		Goals
    		</h3>
    		<p>
      			The goals of this week were to:
				<ol>
					<li>calculate and plot sea-ice fraction (\(f_{sic}\)) and surface wind (\(w\)) speed differences between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pre-Industrial (PI) for individual models & the inter-model mean </li>
      				<li>read four papers, focusing on two themes:
						<ul>
							<li>disequilibrium mechanisms, comparing Hamme (2017) to Loose (2016)</li>
							<li>gas exchange parameterizations, comparing Nicholson (2011, 2016) to Liang (2013)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
    		</p>

				Forcing Comparisons
			</h3>
			<h4>
				Methods
			</h4>
			<p>
				I first determined which products from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) outputted the two variables that we care about: \(f_{sic}\) and \(w\).
				Note that \(w\) is in (m s\(^{-1}\)) in this work.
				In order to have a consistent comparison across both the LGM and PI, I only used those model products that outputted both variables for both time periods of interest. This left 7 models:

				After storing all model data - each varying in latitude, longitude, and time dimension but all having a monthly resolution starting in the first month and ending in the last month of the respective years stated above - a climatological mean for each month was calculated over the entirety of the model run.
				A basic quality control was run over the CMIP5 data.
				All longitude data was put into the [0, 360] if not already.
				Additionally, if the \(f_{sic}\) was out of 100, this was corrected to be out of 1, and we calculated \(w\) from the model meridional and zonal wind magntiudes using:
					\[
						w = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}.
					\]
				Then, all missing data was removed from the datasets and then linearly interpolated to the UVic grid. For \(f_{sic}\), all values less than 0 and greater than 1 were truncated to 0 and 1, respectively.
				Similarly, for \(w\), all negative values were removed.
				Lastly, we average per month over the entire ensemble, giving the final ensemble mean.
				From these arrays, we calculate the absolute delta, \(\Delta\), following in the case of the wind:
					\[
						\Delta w = w_\text{Ensemble} - w_\text{UVic}.
					\]
				To capture the spread of the ensemble, we calculated the maximum and minimum at each UVic grid point.
				We also calculated the spread of each variable at each grid point, following in the case of the wind:
					\[
						\text{S}_w = \max w - \min w.
					\]

				N.B. It is important to note the NCAR data has misplaced NaN data present straight after reading from the .nc data downloaded from the WHOI server.

			<h4>
				LGM Results
			</h4>
			<p>
				First, I present the UVic monthly \(f_{sic}\) below, which are the monthly forcing files for the TMs:
				<img src="images/summer_2022/uvic_sic.png" alt="UVic LGM f_sic">
				Ranging from 0 to 1, we can see that while the northern hemisphere has relatively the same distribution of ice year-round, the southern hemisphere has a slight ice melt most prominent during December and January.
				Note that there is little gradient across the ice fields in both the hemispheres, rather having a binary ice (1) to no ice (0) for most of the fields.
			</p>
			<p>
				The monthly averaged forcing files for \(w\) are then presented below, also used to force the UVic model-derived TMs:
				<img src="images/summer_2022/uvic_ws.png" alt="UVic LGM w">
				We can see that there are strong wind currents around \(45^\circ\)N/S.
				There is a lack of winds (0 m s\(^{-1}\)) around the Equator and near the northern pole.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, I present ensemble mean data below, calculated from the 7 CMIP5 data products as discussed above.
				First, I plot \(f_{sic}\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleMean_sic.png" alt="Ensemble mean LGM f_sic">
				Unlike the UVic forcing files, we can see that there is a large gradient in the northern and southern hemispheres.
				Additionally, there is much more seasonality present in both hemispheres.
				However, we can see that the extent of the ice fields are similar the UVic forcing files.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, we look at \(w\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleMean_ws.png" alt="Ensemble mean LGM w">
				Unlike the UVic forcing files, we can see that there are clearly more than 3 regimes of wind latitudinally.
				Each of these latitudinal bands vary only slightly with season, with the greatest winds in the Northern Atlantic ocean.
			</p>
			<p>
				Applying the definition of \(\Delta\) to the data presented above, we get the differences for \(f_{sic}\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/absDiff_ensembleMean_sic.png" alt="Difference LGM f_sic">
				Most importnatly, we can see that largest difference is in the southern hemisphere, where the ensemble has a greater average (at maximum, 1) for most of the ice field, but the presence of a strong gradient is shown by the negative \(\Delta\) on its perimeter, of nearly 1 as well.
				There is little change in the northern hemisphere, except for the ensemble mean having a slightly higher \(f_{sic}\) than the forcing files, of about 0.5.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, we get the differences for \(w\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/absDiff_ensembleMean_ws.png" alt="Difference LGM w">
				We can see that the largest differences are in both the southern and northern hemispheres around \(45^\circ\)N/S in the Pacific Ocean, where the ensemble has a higher average of about 6 (m s\(^{-1}\)).
				Additionally, there is a negative difference of about -5 (m s\(^{-1}\)) along the Equator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, we look at the ensemble minimums presented below, first for \(f_{sic}\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleMin_sic.png" alt="Minimum LGM f_sic">
				First, we note that there are patches in both the northern and southern hemispheres that are iced over year round.
				There is strong seasonality present in these fields, too,
			</p>
			<p>
				The minimums for \(w\) are next presented below:
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleMin_ws.png" alt="Minimum LGM w">
				Similar to the ensemble mean, we see the same geographic distributions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ensemble maximums are presented below, first for \(f_{sic}\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleMax_sic.png" alt="Maximum LGM f_sic">
				The geographic distribution of the maximums are much like UVic forcing files, which are almost entirely ice filled (1) before quickly turning into open ocean (0).
			</p>
			<p>
				The maximums for \(w\) are next presented below:
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleMax_ws.png" alt="Maximum LGM w">
				Similar to the ensemble mean, we see the same geographic distributions but with less variation in values.
				The greatest values take place in the southern hemisphere.
			</p>
			<p>
				Applying the definition of spread from above, I now present the ensemble spreads for \(f_{sic}\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleSpread_sic.png" alt="Spread LGM f_sic">
				We can see that the greatest spread takes place toward the open ocean, where the ice fields are not there year round.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also present the spread for \(w\):
				<img src="images/summer_2022/ensembleSpread_ws.png" alt="Spread LGM w">
				Similar to the maximum of \(w\), we see that the greatest spread takes place in the southern hemisphere.
			</p>

			<!-- notes of concern -->
			<h4 style="color: red;">
				N.B. My WHOI account was not properly configured by IS, so I was unable to access the WHOI CMPI5 database between Friday and Sunday.
				Getting the data for the PI should not be tricky, as I only need to change the paths.
				The data analysis is done, and I should have this done when we meet on Monday.
